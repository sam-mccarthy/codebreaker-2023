# Task 2

Task 2 was pretty straightforward. Using https://cs140e.sergio.bz/docs/BCM2837-ARM-Peripherals.pdf (page 102) as a reference to check UART pins, and a bit of guesswork on the voltage pins (in the pinout.svg), I was able to get the answer.

The UART pins were a bit odd: IIRC the relevant pins ended up being 32 and 33, and you had to match them to the numbers on the pinout.svg.
